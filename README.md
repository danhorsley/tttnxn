This is a project soley for the purpose of testing uploads
 to github from pycharm and also testing upload to test.pypi
 
 I created a file called my_class which contains 
 (surprsingly!) a class called my_class.
 
 In this class there are some fucntions which do random things 
 to strings.  Two packages are required - random and string.
 
 Fianlly we will test a pip install from test.pypi.  This has 
 failed for me before on previous uploads so I am starting
 this brand new repository.
